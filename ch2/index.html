// functions are objects in JS, and the defining feature they have vs other objects
// is an internal [[Call]] property, which signifies they can actually be invoked
// internal properties are not accessible via code


// function declaration is the most common way of defining
function foo(){};

// function expression is the same as assigning variables
var foo = function(){};

// the difference is that declarations are hoisted to the top of the context, so you can invoke them before are defined in the code

var result = add(5, 5);
function add(num1, num2) {
    return num1+num2;
}

// so the JS engine basically does this:
function add(num1, num2) {
    return num1+num2;
}
var result = add(5, 5);

// function hoisting only happens for declarations because the function name is known ahead of time.
// because JS has first class functions, you can use them just as you do any other objects
function sayHi() {
    console.log('hi');
}

sayHi();

var sayHi2 = sayHi;

sayHi2();

// arguments is a special (array-like object) inside functions thats useful if you're passing an unknown amount of parameters for say, adding

// Most object-oriented languages support function overloading, which is the
// ability of a single function to have multiple signatures.
/* 
 * A function signature * is made up of the function name plus the number and type of parameters
 * the function expects. Thus, a single function can have one signature that
 * accepts a single string argument and another that accepts two numeric
 * arguments. The language determines which version of a function to call
 * based on the arguments that are passed in.
*/

// Javascript functions dont have signatures as they can pass any number of arguments

function sayMessage(message) { 
    console.log(message);
}
function sayMessage() { 
    console.log("Default message");
}

sayMessage("Hello!"); // outputs "Default message"

// if we were in a language that supported function overloading, this would output Hello!
// but in JS the 'last' defined function wins and this outputs Default message
// you can mimic function overloading by branching on the arguments.length inside the function

function sayMessage( message ) {
    if ( arguments.length === 0 ) { 
    } else {
    }
}

// this is bad because "person." makes this tightly coupled
// use "this" for this to be loosely coupled and more dynamic
// if you changed the variable name you would have to change all the instances
var person = {
    name: 'Nicholas',
    sayName: function() {
        console.log( person.name );
    }
};

var person = {
    name: 'Nicholas',
    sayName: function() {
        console.log( this.name );
    }
};

function sayName(message) {
    console.log('Hi, ' + this.name + '. ' + message);
}

// you can change the context of this using call, apply and bind
var person1 = {
    name: 'Nicholas'
};

var person2 = {
    name: 'Pete'
};

sayName.call( person1, "How you doin?" );
sayName.call( person2, "How are you!" );

// the apply method works the same way, but it only accepts two arguments
// first is the context and second is an array to pass as arguments

sayName.apply( person1, ['How are you?']);

// the bind method was added to ES5 and behaves differently than the other two
// the first argument is the new context

// you can either bind the parameters in the bind call
var sayNameForPerson2 = sayName.bind( person2, 'LOL' );
sayNameForPerson2();

// or specify them in the call itself
var sayNameForPerson1 = sayName.bind( person1 );
sayNameForPerson1('Greg');

person2.sayName = sayNameForPerson1;
person2.sayName('How are you!!!!!!!'); // Hi Nicholas, How are you!!!!

// Because functions are objects, there is a Function constructor. You can create new functions with the Function constructor, but this isnâ€™t gen-
// erally recommended because it can make your code harder to understand and debugging much more difficult.
