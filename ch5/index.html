/**
 * When a property is accessed on an object, the JavaScript engine goes
 * through a search process. If the property is found on the instance (that is,
 * if it’s an own property), that property value is used. If the property is not
 * found on the instance, the search continues on [[Prototype]] . If the property
 * is still not found, the search continues to that object’s [[Prototype]] , and
 * so on until the end of the chain is reached. That chain usually ends with
 * Object.prototype , whose [[Prototype]] is set to null .
