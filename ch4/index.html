// Thereâ€™s no need to return a value from the function because the new operator produces the return value.
function Person(){};

var person1 = new Person;

console.log( person1.constructor );
console.log( person1.constructor == Person );

// although constructor points to the right Constructor, you should use instanceof
// because constructor can be overridden

person1.constructor = 'test';

// You *CAN* explicitly call return inside of a constructor. If the returned value is an object, it will be returned instead of the newly created object instance. If the
// returned value is a primitive, the newly created object is used and the returned value is ignored.
function Person2() { this.name = 'bob'; return {name: 'Jack' } };

var person2 = new Person2;
console.log(person2.name); // Jack, not Bob

// You can even use Object.setProperty inside a constructor, as such:

function Person3(name) {
    Object.defineProperty(this, "name", {
        get: function() {
            return name;
        },
        set: function(newName) {
            name = newName;
        },
        enumerable: true,
        configurable: true
    });

    this.sayName = function() {
        console.log(this.name);
    };
};

// Make sure to always call constructors with new ; otherwise, you risk changing the global object instead of the newly created object
console.log(blah); // undefined
function Person4() { this.blah = 'blah'; };
var person4 = Person4();
console.log(blah); // "blah"

// Prototypes
// if you had 100 instances of an object defined with Person3, there would be 100 separate methods of the sayName function
// this is inefficient - and alternatively we can use prototypes
// Almost every function has a built in prototype
// For example the hasOwnProperty method is defined on the generic Object, but it can be accessed from any object as if it were an own property

var book = {};
console.log('hasOwnProperty' in book ); // true
console.log( book.hasOwnProperty('hasOwnProperty') ); // false
console.log( Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty('hasOwnProperty')); // true

// An instance keeps track of its prototype through the [[Prototype]] property
// This property is a pointer to the prototype object that the instance is using
// When you create a new object using new, the constructors prototype property is assigned to the [[Prototype]] of that new object

// Grab the prototype
var o = {};
var prototype = Object.getPrototypeOf( o );

console.log( Object.prototype === prototype ); // true

/*
 * Some JavaScript engines also support a property called __proto__ on all objects.
 * This property allows you to both read from and write to the [[Prototype]] property.
 * Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Node.js all support this property, and __proto__ is on
 * the path for standardization in ECMAScript 6.
 */

// To define multiple prototypal methods, use an object literal
function Person(){};
Person.prototype  = {
    constructor: Person, // this is necessary because the constructor gets reassigned otherwise to Object
    sayName: function(){},
    toString:function(){}
};

// Object.freeze doesnt work on prototypal properties
