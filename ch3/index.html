// When a property is first added to an object, JS uses an internal method called [[Put]] on the object.
// This creates a spot in the object to store the property, like adding a key to a hash table
// This not only specifies the initial value, but also some attributes of the property

// The result of calling [[Put]] is the creation of an own property on the object. This just means its specific to that instance
// of the object, unlike a prototoypal property


// When a new value is assigned to an existing property, the [[Set]] operation takes place
// This replaces the current value with the new one
person.name = 'New Name';


// Detecting properties
// this is unreliable because of type coercion. if age is 0, this is false
if ( person.age ) {
}

// A more reliable way is to use the in operator
if ( 'age' in person ) {
}

// in some cases you want to check for the existence of an own property
if ( person.hasOwnProperty( 'age' )) {
}

if ( 'toString' in person ) { } // this is true but we want to check own property
if ( person.hasOwnProperty('toString') ) { } // this is true but we want to check own property

// Removing properties
// Simply setting a property to null doesnt remove the property completely from the object
// This just calls [[Set]] with a value of null
// You need to use delete

// this returns true when its successful, because some properties can't be removed
delete person.age;


// Enumeration
// this enumerates through all properties including prototypal
for ( var property in person ) { }

// If you just need a list of the object's properties, ES5 introduced the Object.keys method
// which only returns own properties, not prototypal ones
// Keep in mind that not all properties are enumerable. Most of the native methods have their [[Enumerable]] set to false
// you can check using the propertyIsEnumerable method

var properties = Object.keys( person );
console.log(properties.propertyIsEnumerable('length'));
